You can build aerOS successfully if you get `archiso`.<br>
This is a package supplied by Arch Linux that will allow you to build aerOS.<br>

You can check the package version [here](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/archiso/).<br>
We are working to ensure that aerOS can be always built with the latest version of `archiso`.<br>
If it doesn't, please [open an issue](https://github.com/hewol/aerOS/issues/new), and we will fix it.<br>

Run `sudo pacman -Q archiso` before running the build script, then you can proceed to building.<br>

To build aerOS, run `time sudo make` and wait. After some time you should receive your copy of aerOS. Enjoy!
